## Milestone 1

Estimated Duration: 1 month

Estimated delivery date: 2024-07-10

I have read most of Chapters 1 to 3 of Pragmatic MPC.

- Yao's Garbled Circuit
  - point-and-permute (Beaver)
- GMW
  - the 2PC case
  - I don't understand the general case.
- BGW
  - the original method for degree reduction (from the paper)
  - the enhanced method for degree reduction (from the book)
- Beaver Triple (preprocessing)
- BMR
- GESS
  - only the general idea
  - I don't know how to exactly reduce share growth.
- Oblivious Transfer
  - Rabin's classic OT (from the paper)
  - public key based OT (from the book)
  - Beaver's OT extension (from the paper)
  - IKNP's OT extension (from the book)
- PSI
  - with cuckoo hashing (partially)

The main output is an article
(

introducing Yao's Garbled Circuit and Oblivious Transfer. I spent about 8 days creating an interactive web-based tutorial, hoping it can be useful for other teachers when teaching Garbled Circuit.

## Milestone 2

Estimated Duration: 1 month

Estimated delivery date: 2024-08-10

I have read most of Chapters 4 to 5 of Pragmatic MPC.

- GRR3
- FreeXOR
- Half Gates
- Oblivioius Stack
- Random Access Machine + ORAM (partially)
- Path ORAM

### My Articles:

Point-and-Permute: [English](story-point-and-permute-en-US.md) / [Chinese](story-point-and-permute-zh-TW.md)

OT Extension (IKNP): [English](OT3D/story-OT-Extension-en-US.md) / [Chinese](OT3D/story-OT-Extension-zh-TW.md)

### My Programs:

The feature "Point-and-Permute" has been integrated into the original program.<br/>

I hope these programs provide the best visualization for these algorithms.
